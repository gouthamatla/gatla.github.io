I"Î<p>I am a final year PhD sudent in Prof. Jorger Ferrer lab at CRG. My PhD is focussed on human genome regulation and Type-2 Diabetes.</p>

<p>High level understanding of human genome function at various layers and its regulation. Experience in integrative analysis of over 30TB of various human genomics data sets like RNA/CAGE/ATAC/ChIP-Seq, ‚ÄúHi-C‚Äù like and single-cell genomics data to understand genome regulation. Experience in analyzing large scale genetic data to understand the role of common genetic variants in transcriptional and post transcriptional gene regulation and its implications in human disease.</p>
